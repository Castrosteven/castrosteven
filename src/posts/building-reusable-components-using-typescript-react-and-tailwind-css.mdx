# Building reusable components, using Typescript, React and Tailwind CSS

Start by creating a folder in the `src/components` directory. (or wherever you like to keep your components)
I'm going to call this folder `Button`` and inside create and index.tsx file. (You can also just call it Button.tsx).

In here we are going to create a functional component that will return an HTML Button element as JSX.

This Button component will take props, that I've extended from the `ButtonHTMLAttributes` which is imported from the reactjs library.
This interface takes a `<T>` also known as a [Generics Decleration](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html).
Here will pass the [HTMLButtonElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLButtonElement) interface.
This will give access to all the props from the HTML Element , and we use `...rest` aka [Rest Parameters](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#rest-parameters-and-arguments)
to pass down all those props to button.

```typescript:src/components/UI/Button/index.ts
import { ButtonHTMLAttributes } from "react";

interface Props extends ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {}
const Button = ({ ...rest }: Props) => {
  return (
    <button
      className="inline-block px-6 py-2.5 bg-blue-600 text-white 
      font-medium text-xs leading-tight uppercase rounded shadow-md 
      hover:bg-blue-700 hover:shadow-lg focus:bg-blue-700 focus:shadow-lg 
      focus:outline-none focus:ring-0 active:bg-blue-800 active:shadow-lg 
      transition duration-150 ease-in-out"
      {...rest}
    />
  );
};
export default Button;
```

Now we can import this button dirrectly from the this path but it's better to create a single `index.ts`` file to export all your components so you have a single place to import them all.
This makes refactoring much easier down the line if need be.

```typescript:src/components/UI/index.ts
import Button from "../Button";
import Paragraph from "../Paragraph"; // When you create more components down the line
export { Button, Paragraph };
```

To use this component in your application we can import it like so,
We can use all the same props you would pass to your regular button.

```typescript:src/pages/index.ts
import type { NextPage } from "next";
import { Button } from "../components/UI";
const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button
        type="button"
        id="button"
        name="My button"
        onClick={() => {}}
        disabled={false}
      >
        Hello World
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
};
export default Home;
```

The HTML Markup output of this component to the DOM will be like so.

```html
<button
  class="inline-block px-6 py-2.5 bg-blue-600 text-white font-medium text-xs leading-tight 
  uppercase rounded shadow-md hover:bg-blue-700 hover:shadow-lg 
  focus:bg-blue-700 focus:shadow-lg focus:outline-none focus:ring-0
  active:bg-blue-800 active:shadow-lg transition duration-150 ease-in-out"
  type="button"
  id="button"
  name="button"
>
  <p class="font-bold">Hello World</p>
</button>
```

The final Product

<ComponentDisplayer>
  <Button
    type="button"
    id="button"
    name="button"
    onClick={() => {}}
    disabled={false}
  >
    Hello World
  </Button>
</ComponentDisplayer>
