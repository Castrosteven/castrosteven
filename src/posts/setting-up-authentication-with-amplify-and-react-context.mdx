# Setting Up Authentication with Amplify and React Context

We are looking to setup Authentication in for our React JS Application. We are going to set up a Authentication with Email and Password using AWS Amplify and React JS.
To Start up we are are going to create our client side project using the Create React App. 

Then we are going to initilize our cloud project using the AWS CLI. 

Then we are going to create our pages for application

/profile
/settings
/login
/verify-password
/forgot
/signup

Set up React Router to navigate between pages and set up Authenacation Guards

Set up A custom Authencation Hook to manage our Login,Signup, Signup, Pasword Forgot and Password Reset

Setting up a User Context Provider to wrap our application and have access to auth state.

Set up 3 States Authenticated,NotAuthencicated,Loading

Create Custom UI Components 
Button
Text Input


```typescript:src/pages/profile/index.ts
import React from "react";

export const Profile = () => {
  return <div>Profile Page</div>;
};

```

Now we can import this button dirrectly from the this path but it's better to create a single `index.ts`` file to export all your components so you have a single place to import them all.
This makes refactoring much easier down the line if need be.

```typescript:src/components/UI/index.ts
import Button from "../Button";
import Paragraph from "../Paragraph"; // When you create more components down the line
export { Button, Paragraph };
```

To use this component in your application we can import it like so,
We can use all the same props you would pass to your regular button.

```typescript:src/pages/index.ts
import type { NextPage } from "next";
import { Button } from "../components/UI";
const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button
        type="button"
        id="button"
        name="My button"
        onClick={() => {}}
        disabled={false}
      >
        Hello World
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
};
export default Home;
```

The HTML Markup output of this component to the DOM will be like so.

```html
<button
  class="inline-block px-6 py-2.5 bg-blue-600 text-white font-medium text-xs leading-tight 
  uppercase rounded shadow-md hover:bg-blue-700 hover:shadow-lg 
  focus:bg-blue-700 focus:shadow-lg focus:outline-none focus:ring-0
  active:bg-blue-800 active:shadow-lg transition duration-150 ease-in-out"
  type="button"
  id="button"
  name="button"
>
  <p class="font-bold">Hello World</p>
</button>
```

The final Product

<ComponentDisplayer>
  <Button
    type="button"
    id="button"
    name="button"
    onClick={() => {}}
    disabled={false}
  >
    Hello World
  </Button>
</ComponentDisplayer>
